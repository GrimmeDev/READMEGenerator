## Installation
Clone the repo down to your machine using GitBash or Terminal. Once that is done open up an integrated terminal in the same location as `index.js` and type the command: `npm install`. This will automatically install the necessary packages required to run the program.
## Usage
Once the packages have been installed, in the same terminal type the command `node index.js`, you will then be given a series of prompts to answer. These answers will be used to generate the ReadMe.md
